CSIS 294 Project 01 is my first project from my Intermediate Java with Data Structures at Grossmont Community College.

The professor provided the implementation of "Presentable" and of "SequenceSearch", we implemented "SequenceSearchImpl" which extends the SequenceSearch object.

The "SequenceSearchImpl" object when created is passed a content string, a start tag, and an end tag. The object implements four different methods which includes:
getAllTaggedSequences,
getLongestTaggedSequence,
displayStringArray,
toString.

The getAllTaggedSequences methods finds all sub-strings of the content string which are enclosed within the start and end tag and returns it as a string array.

The getLongestTaggedSequences method finds the longest sub-string enclosed within the start and end tag and returns it.

The DisplayStringArray method returns a string of all the sub-strings enclosed within the start and end tag each on a new line and followed by their length.

The toString method returns a string created by removing the tags from the content string
